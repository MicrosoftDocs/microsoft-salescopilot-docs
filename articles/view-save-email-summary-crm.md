# View and save email summary to CRM

When interacting with your customers over email, you often need to update your CRM system with the latest information. Manually updating the CRM system every time you interact with customers via email can be time-consuming and error prone. Additionally, it could potentially add noise to the CRM system, by overloading records with email exchanges.

Copilot for Sales uses AI to summarize email conversations and provides you with options to copy the summary and to add the summary to your CRM system as a note to a record.

When available, the summary includes information whether budget, stakeholders, need, and timing are mentioned in the email or not. This information is displayed only for external emails and when detected with a high probability by AI.

## License requirements

The experience covered within this article is only displayed to Dynamics 365 Sales customers who are accessing the [included capabilities available with their exisitng Sales Copilot license](features-d365-users.md).

   If there are multiple opportunities related to contact, Copilot for Sales displays a list of suggested opportunities, ranked by AI, to save the summary. In this case, the first opportunity is selected by default.

   > [!NOTE]
   > - If the email is already connected to an opportunity, it's selected by default.
   > - If no opportunity is connected, the top ranked opportunity, which is determined by the open opportunities available for the account or contact, and the content of the email, will be selected by default.
   > - When you search for a record, the search results display the record name and the key fields selected by your administrator. For more information about key fields, see [Select key fields for mini view](customize-forms-and-fields.md#select-key-fields-for-the-mini-view).
   > - Your search results will be added to the suggested records list, so you can safely search and try again.
   > - Currently, you can save the summary to one record using Copilot for Sales.
   > - You can connect to all record types that are enabled for activities and added to Copilot for Sales by your administrator. For more information about adding record types, see [Add a new record type (or a Salesforce object)](customize-forms-and-fields.md#add-a-new-record-type-or-a-salesforce-object).
   > - Salesforce has two types of notes objects: "Notes and Attachments" and Notes (also known as Content Notes). You can use either of these objects to take notes and attach to the CRM records. However, Copilot for Sales only supports the "Notes and Attachments" object out of the box. If you want Copilot for Sales to support the Notes object, ask your administrator to contact Microsoft support.
