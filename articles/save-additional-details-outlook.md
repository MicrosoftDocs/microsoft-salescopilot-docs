# Configure how Outlook emails and events are saved to CRM

As an administrator, you can customize how sellers save and categorize emails and meetings in their customer relationship management (CRM) system. This article explains how to configure fields for categorization, manage attachment saving options, and control which activities can be saved to CRM. Use these settings to help sellers organize customer interactions and streamline their workflow in Outlook.

## Prerequisites

CRM administrators must access admin settings from the Copilot for Sales app in Teams. For more information, go to [Microsoft 365 Copilot for Sales admin settings](administrator-settings-for-viva-sales.md).

## Enable or disable saving emails and meetings to CRM

You can control if sellers can save emails and meetings to the CRM. By default, the settings to save emails and meetings to the CRM are turned on. If you turn them off, sellers will no longer be able to save emails and meetings to the CRM.

1. In Copilot for Sales admin settings, select **Save to (CRM)**.
1. To turn off saving emails to CRM, turn off **Save emails to (CRM)**.
1. To turn off saving meetings to CRM, turn off **Save meetings to (CRM)**.

## Configure the fields to save to the CRM

You can select the fields that are saved to the CRM together with emails or meetings. Those fields are then shown to sellers when they save emails or meetings to the CRM. Sellers can easily find and track customer interactions by categorizing emails and meetings in their CRM inbox. For example, sellers might want to categorize emails and meetings based on priority, account, or deal stage.

**Prerequisite**: Depending on the type of activity that you want to configure, [saving emails or meetings to CRM must be enabled](#enable-or-disable-saving-emails-and-meetings-to-crm).

1. In Copilot for Sales admin settings, select **Save to (CRM)**.  
1. Select **Save emails to (CRM)** or **Save meetings to (CRM)**, depending on the type of activity that you want to configure.

1. (Optional) Select **Refresh data** to get the latest updates to the fields from the CRM. For example, if the CRM administrator updated a field label in the CRM, you can refresh the data to view the updated label in Copilot for Sales.  
1. In the **Categorize with fields** section, select **Add fields**.  
1. In the **Add category** dialog box, select the fields that should be shown to sellers.  
    The **Add category** dialog box shows all out-of-box and custom fields of the email and appointment entities in the CRM, except system fields. The dialog box shows only fields of the following types: option sets, look up and text, multiple lines of text (plaintext/Memo), Boolean, and integer.  
1. Save your changes.  

The fields you configured are now available to sellers when they save emails or meetings to the CRM. For more information, go to [Save Outlook activities to your CRM](save-outlook-activities-crm.md).

## Configure attachment saving settings

You can control whether sellers can save attachments along with the email or meeting to CRM. When attachment saving is enabled, you can also configure whether all attachments are selected or not by default to be saved to CRM. In either case, sellers can choose which attachments to save when they save the email or meeting to CRM.

**Prerequisite**: Depending on the type of activity that you want to configure, [saving emails or meetings to CRM must be enabled](#enable-or-disable-saving-emails-and-meetings-to-crm).

1. In Copilot for Sales admin settings, select **Save to (CRM)**.  
1. To configure attachment saving settings for emails:  
    1. Under the **Save emails to (CRM)** section, turn on **Save attachments with emails**.  
    1. To save all attachments by default, select **Save all attachments in the email by default**. If you don't select this option, sellers can choose which attachments to save when they save the email to CRM.
