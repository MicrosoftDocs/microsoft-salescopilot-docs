Sales Chat is a conversational agent available within Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat. It enables sellers to efficiently search, synthesize, and take action on sales data from various applications they use. Sales Chat is useful only when users are connected to a CRM system. Currently, it supports Dynamics 365 Sales and Salesforce.

Sales Chat is available to users who have a Copilot for Sales license. If you don't have the license, you can install Copilot for Sales and use Sales Chat on a consumption basis.

> [!NOTE]
> - Users who don't have a Copilot for Sales license can't use Sales Chat until consumption-based billing is set up.
> - If your team already uses Copilot for Sales, they'll see the Sales Chat in the list of agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat.
> - If all agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat are disabled for your organization, users won't see Sales Chat in the list of agents even if they have a Copilot for Sales license.
