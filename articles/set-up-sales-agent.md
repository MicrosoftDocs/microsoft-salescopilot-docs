# Set up Sales Agent

Sales Agent is a powerful tool that helps you automate your sales processes and improve your productivity. It helps sellers qualify leads by generating insights from deep research and generating personalized outreach emails tailored to the lead.

Sales Agent connects to both Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales and Salesforce Sales Cloud to research your leads, and discover related contact, account, opportunity, and activity records. Sales Agent uncovers the insights hidden in your CRM that go easily missed.

As an admin, you can set up Sales Agent to connect to your CRM and enable it for your users. Once set up, sellers can view summaries of the research within their CRM or browse the list of researched leads in the Copilot for Sales app. 

## Prerequisites

- The Copilot for Sales app is installed in either Outlook or Teams.
- You have access to environment-level settings in the [Copilot for Sales admin settings](administrator-settings-for-viva-sales.md).
- [Copilot AI features must be turned on in your environment](suggested-replies.md).
- The Dataverse environment connected to Copilot for Sales is a production environment. If not, you must convert it to a production environment.
- Message capacity purchased and assigned to the Copilot for Sales environment.

### Additional prerequisites for Salesforce

- Configure the server-to-server connection between Copilot for Sales and Salesforce. Learn more about [Connect your agents to a data source](connect-agent-datasource.md)

## Create a view and query that defines the leads to research

Sales Agent uses a list view to find, filter, and monitor the records to research. The list view also defines which fields the agent will have access to read. You must create a list view that's specific to the Sales Agent and make sure it has access to that list view.

> [!TIP]
> You do not have to use the standard (out-of-the-box) lead object or entity for your leads. If your leads are stored in another type of record, you can choose to define your 'leads' using that object or entity.

Learn more about creating a list view in [Salesforce](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.customviews_lex.htm&type=5) or [Dynamics 365 Sales](/dynamics365/sales/customize-views?tabs=SE).
