# Sales solution in Microsoft 365 Copilot license overview

Sales app is an AI assistant for sellers in Microsoft 365. It connects to sales solutions to provide next-generation AI and customer relationship management (CRM) platform updates and insights across productivity workflows. Subscriptions are licensed per user and include access to Microsoft 365 Copilot.

## Prerequisites

- A product license for Microsoft 365 E3, E5, Business Standard, or Business Premium, or Office 365 E1, E3, or E5, or a version of these suites that does not include Microsoft Teams, is required to purchase Sales app.
- A subscription to one of the following sales solutions is required to use Sales app:

    - Dynamics 365 Sales
    - Salesforce Sales Cloud

## Dynamics 365 Sales

For Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise customers, a few Sales app capabilities are included with their subscription. The capabilities are accessible in Outlook and Teams. They are the same capabilities that are provided with the earlier Sales Copilot license. However, Sales app is an additional purchase and includes all the latest sales-based experiences, Microsoft 365 Copilot, and Teams intelligent recap.

> [!NOTE]
> - Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales Premium users just have to buy Microsoft 365 Copilot to activate Sales app.

In addition, for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales customers, Copilot functionality is embedded in the Dynamics 365 interface. This embedded functionality is referred to as [Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales](/dynamics365/sales/copilot-overview).

Sales app also supports Salesforce Sales Cloud customers. Organizations that use the Microsoft 365 productivity suite and Salesforce can buy Sales app to gain access to the role-based skills and Microsoft 365 Copilot. Sales app optimizes chat, provides integrated actions, and generates insights that combine AI with the data that is held in the CRM application.
