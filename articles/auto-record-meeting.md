# Configure auto-recording for sales meetings

As an administrator, you can enable or disable the auto-recording feature for all sales meetings in your organization. By default, this feature is enabled.

This feature is useful for ensuring that important discussions and decisions are captured without having to remember to start the recording manually. This is particularly useful for sales teams who need to keep track of customer interactions and follow up on action items discussed during meetings.

A meeting is recorded only if it is with external contacts and the Copilot for Sales app is added to the meeting automatically before the meeting. If a meeting is marked as private, it will not be recorded. 

To configure auto-recording for sales meetings:

1. In Copilot for Sales admin settings, select **Meeting agent**.
2. Under **Recordings**, select **Auto-record sales meetings**.
3. In the **Auto-record sales meetings** pane, select **On** or **Off** to enable or disable the feature.
4. Select **Save**.
