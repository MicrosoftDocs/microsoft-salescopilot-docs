# Configure auto recording for sales meetings

As an administrator, you can enable or disable the auto recording feature for all sales meetings in your organization. It ensures that all meetings with external contacts are automatically recorded, so you don't have to remember to start the recording manually. By default, the feature is enabled.

A meeting is recorded only if it is with external contacts and the Copilot for Sales app is added to the meeting automatically before the meeting. 

> [!NOTE]
> If a meeting is marked as private, it isn't recorded. 

To configure auto recording for sales meetings:

1. In Copilot for Sales admin settings, select **Meeting agent**.
2. Under **Recordings**, select **Auto-record sales meetings**.
3. In the **Auto-record sales meetings** pane, select **On** or **Off** to enable or disable the feature.
4. Select **Save**.
