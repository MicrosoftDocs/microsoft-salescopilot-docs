# What's new in Sales Copilot changing to Copilot for Sales

On February 1, 2024, Sales Copilot will be changing to bring the power of Copilot for Microsoft 365 and the role specific insights and actions together under a new offering called Microsoft Copilot for Sales. As part of the effort, we're excited to bring the following updates:

- **New user experience**: The **Highlights** and CRM tabs are merged into one unified view.
- **License changes**: A new Copilot for Sales license is introduced, which includes Copilot for Microsoft 365 subscription.
- **Enhanced Teams app**: The existing Sales Copilot Teams app and Outlook add-in have been upgraded to a single enhanced Teams app. 

## New user experience

The new user experience brings the **Highlights** and CRM tabs together into one unified view. The new view is designed to provide a more streamlined experience by bringing the most relevant information to the top of the view.

## License changes

A new Copilot for Sales license is introduced, which includes Copilot for Microsoft 365 subscription. 

### Existing Sales Copilot license

The existing Sales Copilot license is referred to as Copilot for Sales standard license. The Copilot for Sales standard license will continue to provide the same capabilities as the Sales Copilot license, but with the new order of the cards in the Outlook mailbox view.

:::image type="content" source="media/standard-license-small.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing standard license user interface." lightbox="media/standard-license.png":::

Legend:
1. Email summary and generative replies
1. Save email to CRM is moved to the top and related CRM records are placed after the **Key email info** card.
1. Opportunity summary
1. Create and access collaboration spaces in Teams

In the Outlook calendar view, the cards order will remain the same as in the mailbox view, but there will be no email summary.

In Microsoft Teams, the Copilot for Sales Standard license will continue to provide the same capabilities as the Sales Copilot license. 

### New Copilot for Sales license

The new Copilot for Sales license is referred to as Copilot for Sales premium license. This license also includes the Copilot for Microsoft 365 subscription. In this license, email summary and generative replies are integrated into Outlook as part of the Copilot for Microsoft 365 experience. If you're using the Outlook on the web or the new Outlook for Windows, you can access Copilot for Sales in the Copilot for Microsoft 365 side pane in Outlook.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're a Dynamics 365 Premium customer, you can get the same capabilities as the Copilot for Sales premium license by purchasing the Copilot for Microsoft 365 license.

### Unified side pane in Outlook on the web and Outlook for Windows

For users using Outlook on the web or the new Outlook for Windows, the Copilot for Sales side pane in Outlook is now unified with the Copilot for Microsoft 365 side pane. This allows users to experience a single unified Copilot in Outlook wherein all the Copilot for Sales capabilities can be accessed directly from the Copilot for Microsoft 365 side pane. 

Select the hamburger menu (:::image type="icon" source="media/hamburger.png" border="false":::) in the Copilot for Microsoft 365 side pane and select **Sales** to access the Copilot for Sales capabilities.

> [!NOTE]
> The unified Copilot experience is currently available only in Outlook on the web (Outlook online) and the new Outlook for Windows. For all other Outlook surfaces, users would experience Copilot for Sales capabilities in the dedicated Copilot for Sales side pane in Outlook.

## Enhanced Teams app support

The existing Sales Copilot Teams app and Outlook add-in have been upgraded to a single enhanced Teams app. The enhanced Teams app allows the Teams personal app that includes the **Home** and **Settings** tab to be available in Microsoft 365 applications including Outlook. Additionally, the Teams message extension now allows searching for CRM records and embedding them as rich adaptive cards directly into an email - similar to how it can be used in a Teams chat. The enhanced app also allows the packaging of Copilot for Microsoft 365 capabilities thereby opening up the ability to ask questions such as "Summarize account Fabrikam" directly in the Microsoft 365 chat.

### New deployments

Although the new Copilot for Sales enhanced Teams app is packaged as a single app, deployment is still needed in both the Microsoft 365 admin center for Outlook and Microsoft 365 apps and the Teams admin center for Teams deployment. See deployment guides for details: [Dynamics 365 customers](deploy-viva-sales-d365.md) and [Salesforce CRM customers](deploy-viva-sales-sf.md).

### Update existing Sales Copilot deployments

#### Upgrade the app within Teams 

Due to the upgrade of the previous Sales Copilot Teams app to an enhanced Teams app, every Teams user will be presented with an update button within Teams. In this case, no administration is needed in the Teams admin center. [Learn more about updating an app in Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/update-an-app-in-microsoft-teams-3d53d136-5c5d-4dfa-9602-01e6fdd8015b).

#### Upgrade the app for Outlook 

To get the benefits of the new enhanced Teams app within Outlook, the new app needs to be deployed to the same set of users as the existing Outlook add-in within the Microsoft 365 admin center. [Learn more about installing Copilot for Sales for Outlook](install-viva-sales-as-an-integrated-app.md)

If Copilot for Sales was previously deployed from the Microsoft 365 admin center, the **Merge both versions** button is shown when you [manage the app](install-viva-sales-as-an-integrated-app.md#manage-the-copilot-for-sales-app). You must select **Merge both versions** to upgrade the app to the latest version.
