# Share a link to a CRM record

You can copy a link to a CRM record and then share it in a Teams chat or an email message. When you paste the CRM record's link into Teams chat, it will unfurl into a rich adaptive card. When you paste the CRM record's link in an email message, a link to the record is pasted.
