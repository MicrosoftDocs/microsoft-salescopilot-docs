# Share a CRM record in Outlook by using /mentions

As an administator, you can allow sellers to use /mentions to quickly share a CRM record when composing an email in Outlook. The CRM record is shared as an adaptive card for the CRM record. The adaptive card displays the record details, such as the record name, owner, and key fields. The adaptive card is kept up to date based on the data in your CRM system.

By default, this feature is turned off. To enable this feature, you must turn on the **Quick-share records in Outlook** setting in the Copilot for Sales administrator settings. When this feature is enabled, the data about recently access records in Copilot for Sales is copied to substrate and useed by the /mentions feature in Outlook.

1. [Open Copilot for Sales administrator settings](./administrator-settings-for-viva-sales.md#access-administrator-settings).

1. Under Environment, select **Forms**.

1. Turn on **Quick-share records in Outlook**.
