# Let sellers use /mention to share a CRM record in Outlook

As an administrator, you can turn on a setting in Sales app that lets sellers easily share a CRM record in Outlook. When **Quick-share records in Outlook** is turned on, sellers can type a forward slash (/) and select a record to share it as an adaptive card in an email. The adaptive card displays the record details, such as the record name, owner, and key fields. The adaptive card is kept up to date based on the data in your CRM system.

By default, this feature is turned off. When this feature is enabled, the data about recently accessed records in Sales app is copied to substrate and used by the /mention feature in Outlook.

1. [Open Sales app administrator settings](./administrator-settings-for-viva-sales.md#access-administrator-settings).
