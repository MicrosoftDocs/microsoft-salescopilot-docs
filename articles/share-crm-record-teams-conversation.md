# Share a CRM record in Teams or Outlook

Copilot for Sales enables you to share a CRM record with your team members in a Teams chat or channel conversation, or in an email allowing them to view the record details in the flow of their work. The CRM record is shared as an adaptive card that is kept up to date based on the data in your CRM system.  
In Teams, the adaptive card also displays the AI-generated summary of the record, enabling you to quickly catch up on the details of the record within the flow of your conversation. Note that the AI-generated summary is displayed only if the Copilot features are enabled for your organization.  
You can share a CRM record either by using the Copilot for Sales search message extension or by pasting a link to the record in the chat or email. When you share a record, an adaptive card is created that displays the record details, such as the record name, owner, and key fields.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - For Outlook support, ensure that the [enhanced Teams app has been deployed](whats-new-copilot-sales.md#enhanced-teams-app-support).
> - If you're using Dynamics 365 as your CRM system, and you receive an adaptive card in an email or a Teams chat or channel, you can view data in the adaptive even if you are not signed in to the Copilot for Sales app in Outlook or if you are signed in to a different Dynamics environment, as long as you have read access for the record and Copilot for Sales privileges.
> - If you're using Salesforce as your CRM system, and you receive an adaptive card in an email or a Teams chat or channel, you must be signed in to Salesforce in the Copilot for Sales app in Outlook to view data in the adaptive card while also having read access for the record and Copilot for Sales privileges.
> - Data in the adaptive card is refreshed from the CRM system every time you view the card in Teams chat or email, or when you manually refresh the card.

## Share a CRM record in Teams using search message extensions

1. Go to the conversation in which you want to share the CRM record. Select **More apps** (**...**), search for the **Copilot for Sales** app, and then select it. If the app is pinned to the action bar, select the **Copilot for Sales** icon under the message box.

1. In the **Copilot for Sales** window, search for and select the record.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > - By default, the recently accessed records are displayed, without performing any search. You can either search for the record or select [Advanced search](#share-a-record-using-advanced-search) to search for a particular record type.
   >
   > - If you change the name of a record type in CRM, they are not updated in Adaptive Card or messaging extensions in Teams. For example, if you rename Account to Customer, the name in Adaptive Card and messaging extensions will show as Account.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The fields on a record's card are displayed as configured by your CRM administrator.

1. Send the message to the chat.

If the recipients don't have the Copilot for Sales app installed in Teams, a message is displayed at the bottom of the card prior to sending the message. The message informs the recipients that they need to install the Copilot for Sales app to view the record details. Once the app is installed, the adaptive card is displayed with the record details if the recipients have access to the CRM record, otherwise, a link to the record is displayed in the card.

If the app is blocked by the admin, the message informs the recipients that they need to contact their admin to enable the app.
