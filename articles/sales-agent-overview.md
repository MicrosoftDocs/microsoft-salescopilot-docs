> [!NOTE]
> The Sales Agent is currently being rolled out to different regions in phases. If you don't see the agent in your environment, it might not have reached your region yet. The rollout is expected to be completed by June 23, 2025.

Sales teams need to constantly generate enough pipeline to stay ahead of their sales goals. This requires deciding which leads to engage, a time-consuming process that today requires sellers to sift through large amount of data across tools and data sources, including data from internal systems like their CRM and external resources like the web and third-party data services.

As a seller, you can save time and engage more leads with Sales Agent's AI-generated insights and personalized outreach messages. Sales Agent does the grunt work of looking at every available data source to build a comprehensive summary of each lead so you can quickly decide to engage or pass on the prospect. Sales Agent reviews every lead in your queue, gathers information, and synthesizes insights that are specific to your business. At a glance, you can determine if a lead is worth reaching out to and what they may be interested in. The information is then used to automatically generates personalized emails to send to the lead that increase response rates leading to a larger, more qualified pipeline, at a fraction of the time spent before.

> Sales Agent can also operate autonomously to engage with your leads directly to send emails, follow up, respond to questions, and hand off to sellers when the lead is ready.

## How it works

Sales Agent uses a combination of internal and external data sources to research leads. It connects to your CRM (Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales or Salesforce Sales Cloud) to find leads, and then uses the web and third-party data services to gather additional information about the lead's company, recent news, and other relevant insights. This information is then synthesized into a comprehensive summary that helps you decide whether to engage with the lead or not.

Every lead is deeply researched in advance, instantly ready for you to act upon. Sales Agent gathers key insights, such as if they're a decision maker or even a real person or company, so you can make quick decisions to disqualify or pursue each lead. The company's key information, such as their industry, finances, strategic priorities, and business challenges are summarized to help you learn what you need to know about every lead.

Sales Agent also generates personalized outreach emails based on the insights gathered during the research process. These emails are tailored to the lead's interests and needs, increasing the chances of a positive response.
