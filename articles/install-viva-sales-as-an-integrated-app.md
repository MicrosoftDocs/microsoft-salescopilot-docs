# Install Copilot for Sales in Outlook

As an administrator, you can install Copilot for Sales as an integrated app from Microsoft 365 admin center. The app is installed in Fixed mode by default.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/).

2. In the left pane, select **Settings** > **Integrated apps**.

3. On the **Integrated apps** page, select **Get apps**.

11. When the deployment is complete, select **Done**.

    Allow up to six hours for Copilot for Sales to appear in users' Outlook ribbon.

> [!NOTE]
> The app is installed in Outlook and other Microsoft 365 applications but not in Teams. You need to go to the Microsoft Teams admin center and create setup policies to install the app and assign users. For information about installing Copilot for Sales in Teams, go to [Install and pin Copilot for Sales in Teams](install-pin-viva-sales-teams.md).


> [!IMPORTANT]
> It can take up to 48 hours for the app to appear in Outlook and other Microsoft 365 apps. If users can't see the app after 48 hours, it might be due to the public attachment handling policy.

## Manage the Copilot for Sales app

The **Microsoft Copilot for Sales** panel opens with the following tabs:

2.  On the **Integrated apps** page, select the **Microsoft Copilot for Sales** app.

    The **Microsoft Copilot for Sales** panel opens. If there's an update available for the add-in, a message is displayed in the **Overview** tab.

3. Select **Know more and update**.

4. In the **Updates** panel, select **Accept and update**.

## User-deployed app installation

End users can install the Outlook add-in and Teams app from within Microsoft AppSource in Outlook or Teams respectively, as long as they aren't explicitly blocked by the administrator. Â 

If end users install the Outlook add-in, it's considered user-deployed instead of admin-deployed and will not have full feature support. User-deployed apps don't support Copilot for Sales banner notifications that appear within the top of new or reply emails. Also, the Copilot for Sales is not added automatically to meeting invites. However, sellers can manually add Copilot for Sales to the meeting to get meeting summaries.
