The Copilot for Sales conversation intelligence dashboard is a Power BI template app that provides insights into your sales conversations. The dashboard includes a prebuilt report and pages that help you understand the quality of your sales conversations, and how to improve them.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Any edits you make to the dashboard are overridden if you install a newer version of the dashboard. Consider using the downloaded version as-is to avoid the need to manually edit the dashboard every time you install a new version. For more information, see, [How to edit and publish Power BI reports to a workspace](/power-bi/connect-data/service-template-apps-install-distribute).

## Update the dashboard to a newer version

To learn how to update to a newer version of the dashboard, see [Power BI template apps](/power-bi/connect-data/service-template-apps-overview).

## Configure access permissions in the dashboard

The Copilot for Sales dashboard uses Row-Level Security (RLS) to grant users with access, according to your organization hierarchy, which is imported from the system users table in Dataverse. Admins of Salesforce organizations can sync their organizations hierarchy from either Salesforce or Microsoft Entra ID.

For information about syncing your organization hierarchy see, [How to import hierarchy for Salesforce orgs](hierarchy-settings-sf.md).  
The dashboard uses the organization hierarchy to determine who is each user's manager, and allows access to data based on the defined role of each user.  
For information about RLS see, [Row-level security (RLS) with Power BI](/power-bi/enterprise/service-admin-rls).  
The Copilot for Sales dashboard includes four predefined roles:

- **Seller (Agent)**: Can view data only of conversations to which they have access (can access the conversation summary page).  
- **Sales Manager (Manager)**: Can view data of conversations to which they or their team have summary page access.  
- **Business Unit Admin (BuAdmin)**: Can view data of conversations owned by anyone.  
- **OrgAdmin**: Can view data of all conversations.

For information about configuring RLS in your managers' dashboard, see [Manage security on your model](/power-bi/enterprise/service-admin-rls#manage-security-on-your-model).
