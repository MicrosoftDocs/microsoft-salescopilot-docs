## Automatically summarize emails in the Key email info card

You can control whether emails are automatically summarized in the [**Key email info**](view-save-email-summary-crm.md) card. By default, this setting is turned on. If you turn it off, sellers must manually summarize emails in the **Key email info** card by selecting **Summarize email**.

To configure this setting:

1. [Open the Sales app administrator settings](./administrator-settings-sales-app.md#access-administrator-settings).
1. Under **Features**, select **Email insights (preview)**.
1. Select **Auto-summarize emails**.
1. Turn the toggle on or off to enable or disable automatic email summarization.
