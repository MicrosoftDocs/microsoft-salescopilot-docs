# Uninstall Copilot for Sales app

You can uninstall the Copilot for Sales app from your organization or for individual users. The steps to uninstall the app depend on whether you are an admin or a user.

## Uninstall as a user

You can uninstall the Copilot for Sales add-in for Outlook and the Copilot for Sales personal app from Microsoft Teams.

### Uninstall Copilot for Sales Outlook add-in

1. On the **Copilot for Sales for Microsoft Outlook** card, select **Manage Add-In** (**...**) at the bottom-right, and then select **Remove**.

> [!NOTE]
> If there's no option to uninstall the add-in, it's likely that the add-in was installed by your administrator. Contact your administrator to uninstall the add-in.

## Uninstall as an admin

As as admin, you can uninstall the Copilot for Sales add-in for Outlook using the Microsoft 365 admin center or PowerShell.

### Uninstall using Microsoft 365 admin center

If you've installed the Copilot for Sales add-in for Outlook from the Microsoft 365 admin center, it is considered as admin-deployed. You can remove the Copilot for Sales add-in if your sellers no longer need it.

1.  In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Settings** &gt; **Integrated apps**.

2.  Select **Microsoft Copilot for Sales** and then select the **Configuration** tab.

3. Select the app to be removed and then select **Remove**.

4.  Confirm about your choice and then select **Remove**.

5. When the app is successfully removed, select **Done**.

### Uninstall using PowerShell

If the Copilot for Sales add-in for Outlook was installed automatically for your organization or sellers have installed it themselves, you can use PowerShell to remove it.

> [!NOTE]
> - You must be a tenant administrator to run PowerShell scripts.
> - PowerShell scripts can only be used to uninstall user-deployed add-ins. If you run these scripts to uninstall admin-deployed add-ins, an error message is displayed.
> - To remove the older Sales Copilot add-in, use the app ID `c3b456a3-a41a-4ed4-8040-354f73574021`. If the older add-in is not found, it might have been updated to the enhanced Teams app. In that case, use the app ID `c92c289e-ceb4-4755-819d-0d1dffdab6fa`.
