# Create Planner tasks from suggested tasks

1. In Microsoft Teams, open an account team or deal room channel.

    If task suggestions are available, the **Suggested Planner tasks** card is shown for a post in the channel.

1. On the **Suggested Planner tasks** card, review the suggested tasks. For each task, a task name and assignee are shown.
1. Add a due date for each task. As necessary, edit the task, task name, and assignee.
1. If you have multiple plans in your Planner app, in the **Add to plan** list, select the plan where you want to create the task. Otherwise, select **Create a new plan**.
1. Select the tasks that you want to create, and then select **Create tasks**.

    When the tasks are successfully created, you receive a confirmation message.

1. In the confirmation message, select **Go to Planner** to add the Planner app as a tab in the channel.

Sales team members can update the tasks directly from the Planner app that is added as a tab. They don't have to switch to the Planner app. The Planner app automatically reflects task updates that are made on the tab.
