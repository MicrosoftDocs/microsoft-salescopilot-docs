# Turn on Copilot AI features

Microsoft 365 Copilot for Sales can use communication with sales contacts and information from your organization's customer relationship management (CRM) system to derive AI-powered insights that help your sellers write better emails, take better notes, and stay on top of their deals. As a tenant administrator or CRM administrator, you can set up Copilot AI features for your entire organization (tenant administrator) or specific environments (CRM administrator).

Copilot AI features might or might not be turned on by default, depending on where your tenant is located. For instance, if you're a new customer, your Dynamics 365 organization is located in North America or Europe, and your CRM resides in the same geography as Microsoft Entra ID, then Copilot AI features are turned on by default. Otherwise, you need to turn them on before your sellers can use them.

Copilot AI features in Copilot for Sales are available only in some [supported languages](supported-languages.md).

> [!NOTE]
> After you turn on Copilot AI features, it takes up to 30 minutes for the changes to take effect.

## Prerequisites

If you're a new customer in a region other than North America or Europe, you must provide consent for Copilot to process your data outside of your geographic region, compliance boundary, or national cloud instance.

- Read the [Copilot data movement](copilot-data-movement.md) article carefully.
- Turn on data movement in your tenant and/or environment.

> [!NOTE]
> If the data movement consent isn't provided, Copilot AI features won't be available to your sellers and meeting insights won't be generated.
