# Microsoft 365 Copilot for Sales admin settings

As a tenant administrator or CRM (customer relationship management) administrator, you can use administrator settings to customize how your users experience Copilot for Sales in Outlook and Teams, including who can use AI capabilities, for all environments in your organization.

## Prerequisites

- [The Copilot for Sales app is added to Teams](#add-the-copilot-for-sales-app-to-teams).
- You have the latest version of the Copilot for Sales app in Teams. [Learn how to update an app in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/update-an-app-in-teams-3d53d136-5c5d-4dfa-9602-01e6fdd8015b).

## Who can access administrator settings?

Administrator settings are visible only when you sign in with administrator credentials to Copilot for Sales in Outlook. The permissions you need depend on which CRM you use.

- **Dynamics 365:** You must have the System Administrator or System Customizer role. If you're using a custom security role, you might need [more privileges to use Copilot for Sales](install-viva-sales.md#additional-privileges-required-for-dynamics-365-customers).

- **Salesforce:** Your user profile must have the Modify All Data or Manage Data Integrations permission. Permissions need to be set in your user profile, not in a permission set that's assigned to you.

If you change a user's permissions or security roles in your CRM, ask the user to sign out of Copilot for Sales in Outlook and sign in again for your changes to be reflected. Changes in user permissions or security roles in the CRM can take up to 15 minutes to reflect in the Copilot for Sales app in Teams.
