# Create a new record in your CRM from Copilot for Sales

You can create a new record in your CRM from the Copilot for Sales side pane. This capability is useful when you want to create a new record in your CRM without having to go to the CRM system. New record creation is supported for all record types that your administrator adds to Copilot for Sales.

> [!NOTE]
> - The option to create a new record is available only if your [administrator enables it](customize-forms-and-fields.md#configure-new-record-creation).
> - For each record type, your CRM administrator can enable inline creation, creation in CRM, or both.

## Create a new record by using the global option
