# Boost sales efficiency with CRM-enriched email summaries in Outlook

Sales in Microsoft 365 Copilot integrates Microsoft 365 Copilot in Outlook with your CRM system to help you build customer relationships and close deals faster. Microsoft 365 Copilot summarizes your emails, helping you quickly grasp key details. Sales in Microsoft 365 Copilot enriches those summaries with sales information from your Dynamics 365 or Salesforce CRM. You can copy the summaries to your CRM or share them in other applications.

Email summaries are available when:

- The email content is more than 1,000 characters, or about 150&ndash;200 words in English. If the email is too short, Copilot doesn't have enough information to generate a summary.
- The email is in one of the [supported languages](introduction.md#supported-languages-and-geographies).
- The email isn't encrypted.

> [!NOTE]
> Based on the license you have, you can see the email summary either within Outlook or in the [**Sales** pane in Outlook](view-save-email-summary-crm.md).

## Prerequisites

- [Copilot AI features must be turned on in your environment](suggested-replies.md)
- [You must be enabled to use Copilot in Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365-copilot/microsoft-365-copilot-enable-users)

## View an email summary

1. In Outlook, open an email in the reading pane or in a separate window.

1. Select the **Summary by Copilot** box at the top of the email.

    Microsoft 365 Copilot scans the email content, summarizes the key points, and displays its summary at the top of the email thread.

    If the Sales app detects that the email is from a contact outside your company and finds related records in your CRM, the summary includes the information from your CRM and the Sales in Microsoft 365 Copilot logo appears in the upper-left corner of the **Summary by Copilot** box. Otherwise, Microsoft 365 Copilot generates the summary without sales information from your CRM and the Microsoft 365 Copilot logo appears in the upper-left corner.

1. If the email summary doesn't include CRM information, select the Copilot icon in the upper-left corner of the **Summary by Copilot** box, and then select **Add Sales insights**.

    Sales app searches your CRM and updates the summary with information from related contact, account, and opportunity records.
