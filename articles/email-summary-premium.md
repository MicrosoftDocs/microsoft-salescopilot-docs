# View CRM-enriched email summaries in Outlook

Copilot for Sales brings together Microsoft 365 Copilot in Outlook and your customer relationship management (CRM) system to help you build customer relationships and close deals faster. Microsoft 365 Copilot summarizes your emails, helping you quickly grasp key details. Copilot for Sales enriches those summaries with sales information from your Dynamics 365 or Salesforce CRM. You can copy the summary to a note in your CRM or to share it in other applications.

Email summaries are available when:

- The email content is more than 1,000 characters. That's about 150&ndash;200 words in English. If the email is too short, Copilot doesn't have enough information to generate a summary.
- The email is in one of the supported languages. Learn more in [Supported languages in Copilot for Sales for Outlook and Teams](supported-languages.md#ai-in-copilot-for-sales).
- The email isn't encrypted.

## License requirements

Some features of the Copilot for Sales email summary are different depending on which license you have. If you have a Copilot for Sales license, or Dynamics 365 Premium with Copilot for Sales activated, you can view and copy email summaries as described in this article.

If you have a Sales Copilot license, you can view email summaries, save them directly to your CRM, share them to Microsoft Teams, or copy them for use elsewhere. Learn more in [View and save email summaries to your CRM](view-save-email-summary-crm.md).

The Copilot for Sales license includes a Microsoft 365 Copilot subscription. If your organization purchased Microsoft 365 Copilot separately, Copilot for Sales is available as a step-up license.

## Anatomy of an email summary

Copilot for Sales looks different depending on which version of Outlook you have. If you're using Outlook on the web or New Outlook for Windows, Copilot for Sales is integrated in the Microsoft 365 Copilot side pane. If you're using Outlook for Windows, Copilot for Sales opens in a dedicated side pane. Learn more in [Unified side pane in Outlook on the web and Outlook for Windows](./whats-new-copilot-sales#unified-side-pane-in-outlook-on-the-web-and-outlook-for-windows).

## View an email summary

1. In Outlook, open an email in the reading pane or in a separate window.

1. Select the **Summary by Copilot** box at the top of the email.

    Microsoft 365 Copilot scans the email content, summarizes the key points, and displays its summary at the top of the email thread.

    If Copilot for Sales detects that the email is from a contact outside your company and finds related records in your CRM, the summary includes the information from your CRM and **With Sales insights added** appears in the upper-right corner of the **Summary by Copilot** box. Otherwise, Microsoft 365 Copilot generates the summary without sales information from your CRM.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/email-summary-premium-license-copilot-summary-from-conversation.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a Copilot email summary in Outlook on the web.":::

1. If **With Sales insights added** isn't already selected in the upper-right corner of the **Summary by Copilot** box, select **From this conversation** > **Add Sales insights**.

    Copilot for Sales searches your CRM and updates the summary with information from related contact, account, and opportunity records.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/email-summary-premium-license-copilot-summary-sales-insights.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a Copilot for Sales email summary in Outlook on the web with account and opportunity details added.":::

1. Open the **Copilot for Sales** pane if it isn't already open.

    If the contact is in your CRM, the **Key sales info** card displays a concise summary of the email, along with important information about the account and opportunities related to the contact, with links to the records in your CRM.

    If the contact isn't in your CRM, the **Key sales info** card isn't displayed. Add the contact to your CRM. Learn more in [Create a contact in your CRM from Copilot for Sales](./create-contact-crm-sales-copilot.md). The **Key sales info** card should appear a few moments later. If it doesn't, close and reopen the email.

In the **Key sales info** card, you can perform the following tasks:

- To view basic information about the contact, account, or opportunity, select the link in blue. To open the record in your CRM to view complete details, select :::image type="icon" source="media/open-record.png" border="false"::: on the summary card. You might need to scroll the card to the right to find the icon.

- To check where Copilot got the information for the summary, select a citation number or the **n references** menu, where *n* is the number of citations in the summary.

- To copy the summary to the clipboard, select the copy icon.

- To provide feedback on the email summary, select the thumbs-up or thumbs-down icon. Be sure not to share personal information in your feedback.
