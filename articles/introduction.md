# Welcome to Sales in Microsoft 365 Copilot

[!INCLUDE [vs-rebrand-note](includes/vs-rebrand-note.md)]

Sales app is an AI assistant for sales teams to maximize productivity and close more deals. It brings next-generation AI and sales insights from their CRM platform into the Microsoft 365 productivity tools that they use daily such as Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Teams.  
Depending on the following roles, you can use Sales app to:  

- As a **seller**, you can work more efficiently and improve customer experiences with email assistance, personalized sales content creation, AI-generated insights, and recommendations for next steps.  
- As a **sales manager**, you can empower your team with AI-powered manager insights and collaboration tools.  

Here's how you can use Sales app to improve your sales productivity:

- Customize by integrating with **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales**, **Salesforce Sales Cloud**, and other sales solutions to get insights and recommendations tailored to your business needs.  
- Participate in Teams meetings and access meeting recordings through **Microsoft Teams**. It analyzes sales calls and extracts insights, action items, and more from the meeting recordings.  
- Access calendar events, contacts, and read and write emails through **Microsoft Outlook**. It provides email assistance, insights, and recommendations to help you close deals faster. 

## Consideration

A [Microsoft 365 admin role](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true#commonly-used-microsoft-365-admin-center-roles) is required to [install and set up Sales app](install-sales-app.md). Sales app allows administrators and users to access content and share data outside of Microsoft 365, including with third-party customer relationship management (CRM) services. Such data sharing is subject to Microsoft and applicable third-party CRM terms and conditions. Data sharing isn't enabled until administrators and users in your organization consent to connect their Microsoft work or school account with their CRM account.

> [!NOTE]
> Sales app is not available on Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises).
