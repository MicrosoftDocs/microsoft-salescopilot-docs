# Sign in to CRM from Outlook

After you [open the Microsoft 365 Copilot for Sales app in Outlook](open-app.md#access-copilot-for-sales-in-outlook), you can sign in and connect your CRM account to get a more enriched experience with CRM data.

## Automatically sign in

If you have any Dynamics 365 environment (production or non-production) that has the Copilot for Sales solution, you're signed in automatically to your environment the first time you open the Copilot for Sales pane. The environment you're signed in to is selected per the following rules:


|Scenario  |Auto sign-in rule  |You'll see  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Single environment (production or non-production)     |  Signed in to the available environment       | Message at the top of Copilot for Sales pane        |
|Single production environment and multiple non-production environments     |Signed in to the production environment         |  Message at the top of Copilot for Sales pane       |
|Multiple production and non-production environments     |  Signed in to the first production environment       |  Dialog box to confirm or change the signed in environment       |
|Multiple non-production environments but no production environment     |  Signed in to the first non-production environment       |  Dialog box to confirm or change the signed in environment       |

> [!NOTE]
> Copilot for Sales does not have access to data on your most frequently accessed or most recently accessed environment to automatically sign in. Copilot for Sales fetches a list of environments having the Copilot for Sales solution, and then selects the first environment in the list to automatically sign in to.

### Single environment or single production environment

For first and second scenarios, a message is displayed at the top of the Copilot for Sales pane showing the environment the user was signed in to automatically. It includes a link to change the environment or CRM.

To change the environment or CRM, select **Switch environment**. In the **Signed in to Dynamics 365** dialog box, select another environment from the **Environment** list, and then select **OK**. The **Environment** list displays the friendly name, type (Production/Sandbox), and URL for each environment.
