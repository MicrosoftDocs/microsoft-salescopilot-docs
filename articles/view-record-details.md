# View record details

You can view details about your saved contact and its related records such as account and opportunities. The record types that you can view are determined by your administrator.

If you have a license for People.ai and and your administrator [turned on the People.ai integration](use-extensions.md#integrate-with-peopleai), then [insights from People.ai](people-ai-insights.md) are displayed for contacts, opportunities, and accounts.

1. In Outlook, open the **Copilot for Sales** pane.  

1. In the **(record type)** card, select the record to see the details. For example, if you want to see details of an opportunity, select the opportunity in the **Opportunities** card.
