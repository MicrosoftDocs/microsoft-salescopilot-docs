# View record details

You can view details about your saved contact and its related records such as account and opportunities.

> [!NOTE]
> All record types that are added by your administrator are displayed, if related to contact, when viewing saved contact details.

1. Open the **Copilot for Sales** pane.

1. In the **(record type)** card, select the record to see the details. For example, if you want to see details of an opportunity, select the opportunity in the **Opportunities** card.

If you have a license for People.ai and the capability to display insights from People.ai is [enabled by your administrator](use-extensions.md#integrate-with-peopleai), insights from People.ai are displayed for contacts, opportunities, and accounts. More information: [View People.ai insights](people-ai-insights.md)
