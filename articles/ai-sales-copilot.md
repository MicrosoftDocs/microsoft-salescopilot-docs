# AI in Copilot for Sales

AI in Copilot for Sales uses the power of generative AI to help you create content faster. It can create content for emails, summarize an email conversation, send a follow-up email with meeting summary, and much more.  
Some of the AI capabilities of Copilot for Sales are:

- **Generate email content**: Generate email content when you compose a new email or a reply to an existing email. Choose from pre-defined response categories or enter your own text, and the AI generates the suggested content. Meeting time is automatically added to the email content based on your calendar availability in Outlook. More information: [Use Copilot to kickstart email messages](use-copilot-kickstart-email-messages.md)  
- **Refine generated content**: To make modifications to the generated content, you can refine the results further by providing a new prompt that builds upon the previous suggestion. This allows you to fine-tune your email replies according to the needs and preferences. More information: [Refine suggested content](use-copilot-kickstart-email-messages.md#refine-suggested-content)  
- **Understand the data sources behind generated content**: Hover over any highlighted areas of text to view the data sources behind generated content. More information: [View CRM data](use-copilot-kickstart-email-messages.md#view-data-source-in-suggested-content)
