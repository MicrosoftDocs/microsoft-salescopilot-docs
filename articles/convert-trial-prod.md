# Convert the Copilot for Sales environment from Trial to Production

In certain situations, the Power Platform environment used for Copilot for Sales is of a Trial type. 

If you are using Dynamics 365 and the environment in Dynamics 365 is of type Trial, the Copilot for Sales app is connected to the trial environment.

If you are using a non-Dynamics 365 CRM, such as Salesforce, Copilot for Sales creates a trial Power Platform environment to store settings and some data for the running of the app. The name of the environment is **msdyn_viva**.

You can find the name and details of your environment in the **Environments** section of the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/). The type of the environment is shown in the **Type** column.

> Do not remove or edit the **msdyn_viva** environment because it is holds important data for Copilot for Sales. If the environment is removed or edited, Copilot for Sales might stop working.
