The meeting preparation card contains the following information:

- **Meeting title**: The subject of the meeting as specified in the meeting invite. It is a clickable link that opens the meeting in calendar.
- **Meeting date and time**: The scheduled date and time of the meeting.
- **Highlights**: Below the meeting details, the card displays up to three high-value AI highlights to help you prepare more effectively. These highlights are dynamically generated based on:
    - Previous meetings and emails with the customer.
    - Insights contributed by other sellers on the same account.
    - CRM-linked context such as contacts, opportunities, and account activity.
    - The inferred sales stage and meeting intent.

    Highlights may include:
    - Key discussion themes or priorities from recent customer interactions.
    - Risks, objections, or open questions to be aware of before the meeting.
    - Notable stakeholders or decision-makers involved in recent communications.
    
    Each highlight is written to be actionable and concise, enabling you to absorb the most important context in seconds.
- **Prepare with insights**: A button that opens the detailed meeting preparation view alongside [Sales agent chat interface](../meeting-prep-sales-chat.md). This allows you to explore deeper insights, ask follow-up questions, and access additional context without leaving your workflow.

The detailed meeting preparation view includes:

- **Meeting information**: View the meeting title, time, and a direct link to open the meeting in calendar.
- **Highlights**: This section offers more detailed information on the topics featured in the meeting card. Each highlight includes relevant context and recommends actions tailored to your upcoming meeting.
- **CRM record summary**: This section is displayed only if the meeting is linked to a CRM record such as an opportunity or account. It shows AI-generated summary of the record. Note that meeting can only be linked to a CRM record from the **Sales** pane in Outlook.
- **Customer communication**: This section is displayed only if the meeting is connected to an opportunity. It shows insights from recent emails and meetings related to the linked CRM record. It may include insights from conversations organized by other team members for the same record, providing a complete view of past customer interactions. Note that insights are displayed only if enabled by your administrator. Learn more about the [Customer communication card](../view-customer-communication.md).
- **AI-generated insights**: This section provides in-depth, AI-driven context to help you prepare for your meeting. It includes:
    - **Meeting overview**: A summary of the meeting's purpose.
    - **Company overview**: AI-generated highlights about the company. If no CRM record is linked, AI uses the domains of external attendees to infer the company. If there are multiple domains, AI selects the best match.
    - **External attendees**: AI-enriched details about external participants, based on their email domains (not just CRM contacts).
    - **Talking points**: Tailored to your role (for example, seller or executive), and may include:
      - Strategic themes
      - Icebreaker questions
      - Discovery questions
      - Potential use cases
      - Likely objections
    - **Communication highlights (optional)**: An AI summary of previous team discussions, such as:
      - What's going well
      - What are the risks
      - What's happening next

    You can configure the view to show insights either in a card-based format or as a list. Select **View** and then choose **Card** or **All in one**.
