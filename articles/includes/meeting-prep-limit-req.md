## Meeting requirements for preparation cards

To generate a meeting preparation card, the meeting must meet the following requirements:

- Has at least one internal participant and no more than 29 internal participants
- Is not cancelled
- Is not marked as private
- Is not an all-day event
- Is not a recurring meeting
- Is scheduled for a future date and time

## Limitations

- The Sales app is automatically added to Teams meetings that include at least one external participant. This process may take a few minutes after the meeting is created and is required for the meeting to be recognized as a sales meeting. If you start and record the meeting before the Sales app has been added, the meeting will not be recognized as a sales meeting and no post-meeting follow-up notification will be generated.
- Only past meetings have insights generated. Email insights are not included currently.
- Meeting insights are linked only to one opportunity in CRM. 
- The card is sent only after the meeting is initially scheduled. If you make changes to the meeting after it's scheduled, no new card is generated.
