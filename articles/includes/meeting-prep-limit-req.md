## Meeting requirements for preparation cards

To generate a meeting preparation card, the meeting must meet the following requirements:

- Has at least one internal participant and no more than 29 internal participants
- Isn't canceled
- Isn't marked as private
- Isn't an all-day event
- Isn't a recurring meeting
- Is scheduled for a future date and time

## Limitations

- The Sales app is automatically added to Teams meetings that include at least one external participant. This process might take a few minutes after the meeting is created and is required for the meeting to be recognized as a sales meeting. If you start and record the meeting before the Sales app is added, the meeting isn't recognized as a sales meeting and no post-meeting follow-up notification is generated.
- Only past meetings have insights generated. Email insights aren't included currently.
- Meeting insights are linked only to one opportunity in CRM. 
- The card is sent only after the meeting is initially scheduled. If you make changes to the meeting after scheduling it, no new card is generated.
