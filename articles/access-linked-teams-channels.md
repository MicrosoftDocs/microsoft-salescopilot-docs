# Access linked teams and channels in Outlook and Sales

[Collaboration spaces](./collaboration-space.md) in Microsoft Teams offer purpose-built places to work with your colleagues and customers on account and opportunity activities&mdash;but what if Teams isn't part of your normal workflow? If you prefer to work in Outlook or Dynamics 365 Sales, you can still get convenient access to teams and channels that you linked to your CRM using a sales template or [enhanced collaboration in the Sales app](/dynamics365/sales/teams-integration/teams-collaboration-enhanced-experience).

## Access linked teams and channels from Outlook

1. In Outlook, open Copilot for Sales, and scroll down to the **Collaborate in Teams** card.

    The card shows the teams and channels that were linked from the Sales app (indicated by the Dynamics 365 Sales icon) or created in Outlook using the Copilot for Sales add-in.

## Access linked teams and channels from Dynamics 365 Sales

The Sales app offers two ways to get to your collaboration spaces.

In Dynamics 365 Sales, start by opening the account or opportunity.

- Select **Collaborate**, select a team or channel, and then select **Open in Teams**.

    The **Collaborate in Microsoft Teams** window shows the teams and channels that were created in Outlook using the Copilot for Sales add-in (indicated by the Copilot for Sales icon) or linked from the Sales app.

    The **Teams chats** pane shows the teams and channels that were created in Outlook using the Copilot for Sales add-in (indicated by the Copilot for Sales icon) or linked from the Sales app.
