| Parameter | Data type | Required | Details |
|-----------|-----------|----------|---------|
| value | Array | Yes | <p>A list of insights (objects) that are defined as described in the [Schema for insights](#schema-for-insights) section.</p><p>**Note**: Although this parameter includes a list of insights, only the first insight is used in the email enrichment summary.</p> |

### Schema for insights

| Description | String | Yes | The insight that is delivered to users, such as *Your colleagues Mona Kane, Ray Tanaka, and Daniela Smith have worked with them before.* | This output indicates the text you would like to be included in the email summary. |

> [!NOTE]

    "value": [
        {
            "title": "From Contoso Customer Insights",
            "description": "Your colleagues Mona Kane, Ray Tanaka, and Daniela Smith have worked with them before."
        }
    ],
    "hasMoreResults": false
}
```

The example in the following image shows how the output of the API is mapped to the email summary.
