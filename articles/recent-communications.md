# View recent communication in Copilot for Sales

If you recently used Outlook or Teams to interact with a customer, the **Recent communication** card in the Copilot for Sales pane in Outlook shows your recent email threads and Teams meetings with that customer. From the card, you can get AI-based summaries of the email threads. You can also open the email threads and meeting invitations in Outlook. Therefore, you can quickly catch up on the customer context and move deals forward through informed responses.

Information on the **Recent communication** card is shown in the context of the email or meeting that is opened in Outlook. You can view up to the three most recent email threads and the three most recent Teams meetings that you had with the first external contact in the open email or meeting during the last 30 days. (The first external contact is the first contact in the email or meeting who isn't from your organization.) Depending on whether the email or meeting was opened in read or compose mode, the first external contact is selected from the following email addresses.

| Outlook item | Read mode | Compose mode |
|---|---|---|
| Email | Sender + To + Cc | To + Cc |
| Meeting | Organizer + Required + Optional | Required + Optional |

The **Recent communications** card retrieves the following communications from Microsoft Graph:

- Communications from the external contact to you
- Communications from you to the external contact
- Communications from others to the external contact that include you

> [!NOTE]
> - The **Recent communication** card shows the most recent email threads that differ from the current thread. It doesn't show previous responses from the current email thread.
> - The **Recent communication** card shows only meetings that include a Teams meeting link.
> - The **Recent communication** card doesn't show recurring meetings. However, it shows the first instance of a recurring meeting if that instance occurred during the last 30 days.
> - If there were no email threads or Teams meetings with the first external contact during the last 30 days, the **Recent communication** card isn't shown.
