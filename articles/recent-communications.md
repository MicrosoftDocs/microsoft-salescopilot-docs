# View recent communication in Copilot for Sales

If you've interacted with a customer recently using Outlook or Teams, you can view your recent email threads and Teams meetings with the customer in the **Recent communication** card in the Copilot for Sales pane in Outlook. You can get AI-based summaries of past email conversations and open the email thread and meeting invitation in Outlook. With this capability, you can quickly catch up on the customer context and move deals forward with informed responses.

Information in the **Recent communication** card is displayed in the context of the email or meeting opened in Outlook. You can see up to three most recent email threads and Teams meetings in the last 30 days with the first external contact in the email or meeting. The first external contact is the first contact in the email or meeting who isn't from your organization. Depending on whether the email or meeting is opened in the read or compose mode, the first external contact is picked from below list of email addresses:

|Outlook item|Read mode|Compose mode|
|---|---|---|
|Emails|Sender + To + Cc|To + Cc|
|Meetings|Organizer + Required + Optional|Required + Optional|

The **Recent communication** card retrieves the following communications from Graph:
- Communications from the external contact to you 
- Communications from you to the external contact 
- Communications from others to the external contact that include you 

> [!NOTE]
> - The **Recent communication** card shows most recent email threads that are different from the current thread. It does not show previous responses in the current email thread.
> - The **Recent communication** card shows meetings that include a Teams meeting link. Meetings without a Teams meeting link aren't shown in the card.
> - If there are no recent email threads or Teams meetings with the first external contact in the last 30 days, the **Recent communication** card is not displayed.
> - Recurring meetings are not shown in the **Recent communication** card. However, the card shows the first instance of the recurring meeting if it's within the last 30 days.
