## Prerequisites

- You must be a tenant administrator to install the integrated app from the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/). [How do I find my tenant admin?](sales-copilot-faq.md#how-do-i-find-my-tenant-admin)
- You must be a Teams administrator to create a setup policy in the [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/dashboard).
- You must assign the Copilot for Sales license to each user that will be using the product. [Learn more about assigning licenses from the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true)

## Step 1: Install Copilot for Sales in Outlook

[Install Copilot for Sales in Outlook](install-viva-sales-as-an-integrated-app.md)

![Screenshot showing Copilot for Sales installed as an add-in for Outlook.](media/integrated-app-admin-center.png "Screenshot showing Copilot for Sales installed as an integrated app.")

## Step 2: Create a policy to automatically install and pin the Copilot for Sales app in Teams

[Install and pin Copilot for Sales in your sellers' personal Teams environment and meetings they create](install-pin-viva-sales-teams.md)

![Screenshot showing Teams policy.](media/teams-policy-viva-sales.png "Screenshot showing Teams policy.")

## Step 3: Enable Teams meeting transcripts

Enable transcripts for Teams calls so that when Copilot for Sales is added to a recorded Teams meeting, it can generate a meeting summary.

1.  Sign in to the [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com).

2.  In the left pane, select **Meetings** &gt; **Meeting policies**.

3.  On the **Manage policies** tab, select **Global (Org-wide default)**.

5.  On the **Global (Org-wide default)** page, scroll down to the **Recording & transcription** section, and turn on the **Transcription** toggle.

6.  Select **Save**.

## Step 4: Set up server-side synchronization of emails and appointments

Copilot for Sales allows sellers to save Outlook emails and appointments to Dynamics 365. Saving Outlook activities to Dynamics 365 requires [server-side synchronization for emails and appointments](/power-platform/admin/set-up-server-side-synchronization-of-email-appointments-contacts-and-tasks) to be enabled. While sellers can enable server-side synchronization for their own mailboxes when they save Outlook activities to Dynamics 365 using Copilot for Sales for the first time, you can simplify their experience by setting up server-side synchronization of emails and appointments for all Copilot for Sales users. 

For information about enabling server-side synchronization, see [Connect to Exchange Online](/power-platform/admin/connect-exchange-online). 

## Step 5: Confirm users have the right security roles

If you're using the following out-of-the-box Dynamics 365 Sales security roles, you don't need to do anything. Copilot for Sales privileges are added automatically for:

-   Primary sales roles: Salesperson or Sales Manager

-   Administration roles: System Administrator or System Customizer

If you're using custom security roles, [assign users the right roles and privileges required for Dynamics 365 customers](install-viva-sales.md#privileges-required-for-dynamics-365-customers).

## Step 6 (optional): Customize Copilot for Sales

[Administrator settings](administrator-settings-for-viva-sales.md) control the seller's Copilot for Sales experience in Outlook and Teams. You can customize Copilot for Sales to meet your organization's needs.

### Set up Copilot AI features

You can [set up AI features in Copilot for Sales](suggested-replies.md) to use AI features that are in preview or generally available.

### Customize forms and fields

Copilot for Sales comes configured to allow users to be productive out-of-the-box. You can [customize forms and fields](customize-forms-and-fields.md) as needed.

### Integrate with other applications

You can [integrate Copilot for Sales with other applications](use-extensions.md) to extend the capabilities of Copilot for Sales.

## Step 7: Welcome sellers to Copilot for Sales

Now that you've installed and configured Copilot for Sales in Outlook and Teams, get your sellers to use it. Here's an example email message you can share.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - It can take up to 48 hours for the app to appear in Outlook and other Microsoft 365 apps. If users can't see the app after 48 hours, it might be due to the public attachment handling policy. More information: [Why can't users see the Copilot for Sales app in Outlook after it's deployed?](sales-copilot-faq.md#why-cant-users-see-the-copilot-for-sales-app-in-outlook-after-its-deployed)
> - Copilot for Sales doesn't support multiple tenants. It uses Microsoft Entra ID credentials to authenticate end users, so access is restricted to environments in the same tenant.
> - Users added as guests to a tenant can't access Copilot for Sales.

## Automatic installation

To make onboarding to Copilot for Sales easier for select organizations, Microsoft automatically installs Copilot for Sales for all users with an appropriate license. The following licenses include Copilot for Sales by default:
- Microsoft 365 Copilot for Sales license
- Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise
- Dynamics 365 Sales Premium

In some cases, the Power Platform licensees can also get Copilot for Sales automatically installed. These users can start using basic capabilities of Copilot for Sales such as email drafting and email summarization without signing in to their CRM. If your sellers are using a Dynamics 365 license that doesn't include Copilot for Sales, or the Salesforce CRM, or Power Apps, you can purchase the appropriate license. [Visit the pricing page for information about license cost](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot/copilot-for-sales#Pricing).

> [!NOTE]
> To simplify your sellers' experience for automatic installation of Copilot for Sales app, you can set up [server-side synchronization](/power-platform/admin/connect-exchange-online) of emails and appointments for all Copilot for Sales users.

### How is auto installation rolled out?

Auto installation is rolled out in phases to select organizations. Organization receives a notification in both the **Microsoft 365 admin center** and the **Power Platform admin center**. Each organization can opt out of auto installation in the specified period of time. Once the capability is rolled-out, the Outlook add-in and Microsoft Teams app can't be uninstalled from **Microsoft 365 admin center**, but users can choose to uninstall them from their respective Outlook and Teams clients, and a new install won't be performed automatically.

### Are there any limitations for auto installed apps?

Auto installed apps are considered as user-deployed and won't have full feature support. User-deployed apps don't support Copilot for Sales banner notifications that appear within the top of new or reply emails. Also, the Copilot for Sales isn't added automatically to meeting invites. However, sellers can manually add Copilot for Sales to the meeting to get meeting summaries. To get full feature support such as banner notifications, you must install the app for your sellers from **Microsoft 365 admin center**. In this way, the apps are considered as admin-deployed and have full feature support.

### How to uninstall auto installed apps?

Auto installed apps can be uninstalled by users from their respective Outlook and Teams clients. For more information on how to uninstall user-deployed apps, see:

- [Uninstall Copilot for Sales Outlook add-in](disable-viva-sales.md#uninstall-copilot-for-sales-outlook-add-in)
- [Uninstall Copilot for Sales app from Microsoft Teams](disable-viva-sales.md#uninstall-copilot-for-sales-app-from-microsoft-teams)

### How to opt out of auto installation?

If your organization is enrolled for auto installation and would like to opt out of future auto installation for new users, fill out the [opt-out form](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2254756). It may take up to two weeks for the opt-out to take effect. Note that Outlook add-in and Microsoft Teams app are not uninstalled from existing users.
