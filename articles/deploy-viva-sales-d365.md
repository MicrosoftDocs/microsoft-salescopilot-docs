## Prerequisites

- You must be a tenant administrator to install the integrated app from the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/). [How do I find my tenant admin?](sales-copilot-faq.md#how-do-i-find-my-tenant-admin)
- You must be a Teams administrator to create a setup policy in the [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/dashboard).
- You must assign the Copilot for Sales license to each user that will be using the product. [Learn more about assigning licenses from the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true)

## Step 1: Install Copilot for Sales in Outlook

[Install Copilot for Sales in Outlook](install-viva-sales-as-an-integrated-app.md)

![Screenshot showing Copilot for Sales installed as an add-in for Outlook.](media/integrated-app-admin-center.png "Screenshot showing Copilot for Sales installed as an integrated app.")

## Step 2: Create a policy to automatically install and pin the Copilot for Sales app in Teams

[Install and pin Copilot for Sales in your sellers' personal Teams environment and meetings they create](install-pin-viva-sales-teams.md)

![Screenshot showing Teams policy.](media/teams-policy-viva-sales.png "Screenshot showing Teams policy.")

## Step 3: Enable Teams meeting transcripts

Enable transcripts for Teams calls so that when Copilot for Sales is added to a recorded Teams meeting, it can generate a meeting summary.

1.  Sign in to the [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com).

2.  In the left pane, select **Meetings** &gt; **Meeting policies**.

3.  On the **Manage policies** tab, select **Global (Org-wide default)**.

5.  On the **Global (Org-wide default)** page, scroll down to the **Recording & transcription** section, and turn on the **Transcription** toggle.

6.  Select **Save**.

## Step 4: Set up server-side synchronization of emails and appointments

Copilot for Sales allows sellers to save Outlook emails and appointments to Dynamics 365. Saving Outlook activities to Dynamics 365 requires [server-side synchronization for emails and appointments](/power-platform/admin/set-up-server-side-synchronization-of-email-appointments-contacts-and-tasks) to be enabled. While sellers can enable server-side synchronization for their own mailboxes when they save Outlook activities to Dynamics 365 using Copilot for Sales for the first time, you can simplify their experience by setting up server-side synchronization of emails and appointments for all Copilot for Sales users. 

For information about enabling server-side synchronization, see [Connect to Exchange Online](/power-platform/admin/connect-exchange-online). 

## Step 5: Confirm users have the right security roles

If you're using the following out-of-the-box Dynamics 365 Sales security roles, you don't need to do anything. Copilot for Sales privileges are added automatically for:

-   Primary sales roles: Salesperson or Sales Manager

-   Administration roles: System Administrator or System Customizer

If you're using custom security roles, [assign users the right roles and privileges required for Dynamics 365 customers](privileges.md#privileges-required-for-dynamics-365-customers).

## Step 6 (optional): Customize Copilot for Sales

[Administrator settings](administrator-settings-for-viva-sales.md) control the seller's Copilot for Sales experience in Outlook and Teams. You can customize Copilot for Sales to meet your organization's needs.

### Set up Copilot AI features

You can [set up AI features in Copilot for Sales](suggested-replies.md) to use AI features that are in preview or generally available.

### Customize forms and fields

Copilot for Sales comes configured to allow users to be productive out-of-the-box. You can [customize forms and fields](customize-forms-and-fields.md) as needed.

### Integrate with other applications

You can [integrate Copilot for Sales with other applications](use-extensions.md) to extend the capabilities of Copilot for Sales.

## Step 7: Welcome sellers to Copilot for Sales

Now that you've installed and configured Copilot for Sales in Outlook and Teams, get your sellers to use it. Here's an example email message you can share.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - It can take up to 48 hours for the app to appear in Outlook and other Microsoft 365 apps. If users can't see the app after 48 hours, it might be due to the public attachment handling policy. More information: [Why can't users see the Copilot for Sales app in Outlook after it's deployed?](sales-copilot-faq.md#why-cant-users-see-the-copilot-for-sales-app-in-outlook-after-its-deployed)
> - Copilot for Sales doesn't support multiple tenants. It uses Microsoft Entra ID credentials to authenticate end users, so access is restricted to environments in the same tenant.
> - Users added as guests to a tenant can't access Copilot for Sales.
