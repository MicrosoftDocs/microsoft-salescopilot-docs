# Microsoft Copilot for Sales FAQ

We've compiled a list of frequently asked questions and provided brief answers to help you get the required information quickly.


## General

### What is Copilot for Sales?  

Microsoft Copilot for Sales brings together the power of Copilot for Microsoft 365 with seller workflows. Microsoft Copilot for Sales leverages data from their CRM platform, as well as large language models and data from Microsoft Graph, Microsoft 365 apps, and the internet. Copilot for Sales helps sales teams save time and energy, generate innovative ideas, build stronger customer relationships and ultimately close more deals.   

Some of the new innovations enabled in Copilot for Sales include a newly integrated experience with Microsoft Word and Microsoft Teams.  Sellers can prompt Copilot to create a meeting preparation brief in Microsoft Word, automatically populated with customer information such as an account and opportunity summary, names and titles of meeting participants, open tasks, highlights from recent meetings and email threads, and more. In addition, meeting recaps in Microsoft Teams can surface action items and tasks, conversation key performance indicators (KPIs), and sales keywords. Sellers can also customize AI-assisted sales processes with Copilot Studio, bringing tailored experiences informed by their own data, logic and actions for specific scenarios. 

Copilot for Sales includes the Copilot for Microsoft 365 subscription and will be available February 1, 2024. [See our pricing page for more information](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/microsoft-sales-copilot#featuresandpricing). 

### How does Copilot for Sales work?

:::image type="content" source="media/license-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing license details." lightbox="media/license-details.png":::

### Will Copilot for Sales be included in Dynamics 365 Sales subscriptions?

No, Copilot for Sales (premium) won't be included in any Dynamics 365 Sales subscriptions, as it includes Copilot for Microsoft 365 (for example, Copilot in PowerPoint, Copilot in Word, and more). 

Dynamics 365 Sales Premium customers can unlock Copilot for Sales with an additional purchase of Copilot for Microsoft 365. The sales capabilities are activated when a user has Sales Premium and Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 associated to their user profile. All other Dynamics 365 Sales customers must purchase the Copilot for Sales subscription to get the full power of the product.  

Note that Dynamics 365 Sales customers (Enterprise and Premium) will continue to have access to standard functionality (formerly known as Viva Sales or Sales Copilot) without purchasing Copilot for Sales. See the chart above for the included features.

### How does the new Copilot for Sales affect Dynamics 365 Sales? Is there any change in capability or licensing for Dynamics 365 Sales customers?  

There's no change or impact. 

Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise and Premium licenses will still include Copilot capabilities in the Dynamics 365 Sales platform (for example, meeting preparation summary in Dynamics 365), as well as a standard set of Copilot for Sales capabilities in Outlook and Teams, which mirror the Sales Copilot capabilities today such as email generation in Outlook, email summary in Outlook, contact updates in Outlook.  

We will continue to innovate on Copilot experiences in the Dynamics 365 Sales platform, such as the [announcements at Ignite](https://aka.ms/Ignite2023BAannounceblog) for natural language support in Dynamics 365 Sales. Customers can use this functionality without purchasing Copilot for Sales. 

Future innovation in Copilot across the Microsoft 365 apps will require purchase of Copilot for Sales. For more detail, see the license chart above which highlights all of the current Copilot functionality that is included in Dynamics 365 Sales licenses.  

### What happens to the standalone Microsoft Sales Copilot subscription? What happens to the customers who purchased that standalone subscription?  

Microsoft Copilot for Sales subscription replaces the Microsoft Sales Copilot subscription. The capabilities in Sales Copilot will continue to be available and further enhanced with the power of Copilot for Microsoft 365, under the new Copilot for Sales subscription. The integration with Word and enhanced integration with Teams are just some examples of the innovations to come.

We appreciate the customers that have invested early in the standalone Sales Copilot subscriptions. They can remain on their existing subscriptions with access to the current functionality during their contracts. If they wish to try the new capabilities in Copilot for Sales, they must make the move to the new license model.

## Functionality

### How does Copilot work?  

Copilot works by harnessing the power of foundational models, proprietary Microsoft technologies and customer business data. Search technologies like Bing and Azure Cognitive Search bring domain-specific context to Copilot from content like manuals and documents stored in customer’s own tenant. Microsoft applications like Dynamics 365 and Power Platform bring crucial context with data stored in Microsoft Dataverse. Finally, Microsoft Graph API provides additional context from sources such as emails, chats, documents, meetings etc. 

Every time a customer uses Copilot to perform a task, three things happen. 

Copilot receives an input prompt from a business user in an application. For example, if a user prompts Copilot with "Show me recent news about ABC Corp." Copilot then preprocesses the prompt using an approach called grounding which uses enterprise data stored in Microsoft Graph and Dataverse. Grounding improves specificity and helps deliver relevant responses.  

Next, the enriched prompt is sent to an appropriate LLM (large language model). The LLM returns a response, and Copilot then postprocesses this response, which includes additional grounding calls to customer data, responsible AI checks, security, compliance, and privacy reviews. 

Then, Copilot returns this recommended response to the business user via a command back to the application who then assesses before choosing to use it.

### Why can't users see the Copilot for Sales app in Outlook after it's deployed?

After you deploy the Copilot for Sales app from the Microsoft 365 admin center, it can take up to 48 hours for the app to appear in Outlook and other Microsoft 365 apps. If the app doesn't appear after 48 hours, ensure that the public attachment handling is enabled for your mailbox policy. This policy blocks the display of the enhanced Teams apps within Microsoft 365 apps. For instructions to enable public attachment handling, see [Public attachment handling in Exchange Online](/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/outlook-on-the-web/public-attachment-handling#task-3---enable-public-attachment-handling-on-an-outlook-on-the-web-mailbox-policy).

- WacViewingOnPublicComputersEnabled
- WacViewingOnPrivateComputersEnabled
- DirectFileAccessOnPublicComputersEnabled
- DirectFileAccessOnPrivateComputersEnabled

### Why do users see duplicate icons for Copilot for Sales in Outlook desktop?

## Forms and fields customization

### Are changes in the CRM reflected automatically in Copilot for Sales?

Changes made in the CRM aren't reflected automatically in Copilot for Sales. You must select **Refresh data** on the **Customize forms and fields** page to get the latest updates from the CRM. More information: [Refresh data](#refresh-data-from-crm)

### Why is the delete option disabled for some fields in the contact record?

If you enable new contact creation from within Copilot for Sales, you can't remove a field from the contact form if it's marked as required in CRM.

### Which fields can't be customized?

The following fields can't be added from the Copilot for Sales **Admin settings** page:

**Dynamics 365**

-   Fields of type File, Image, Rich text, or MultiSelect Option Set.

-   Entity Id

-   All fields where [**IsValidODataAttribute**](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.metadata.attributemetadata.isvalidodataattribute?view=dataverse-sdk-latest&preserve-view=true) is set to false. 

**Salesforce**

### How are hyperlink formula fields from Salesforce CRM displayed in Copilot for Sales?

In Salesforce CRM, hyperlink formula fields are rendered as rich text in Salesforce Lightning, allowing users to click on the link. In Copilot for Sales, hyperlink formula fields containing URLs (but no images) are displayed as clickable links.

### Why are users getting an error with error code 4100 when viewing a CRM record?

If you've connected Copilot for Sales to Salesforce, and your users see a 4100 error when viewing a CRM record, they don't have access to some of the fields added to be displayed. Ensure that all users of the app have access to the fields added to a CRM record.

### Why don't I see the desired relationship for a record type during configuration?

The relationship between record types is based on the order in which record types are added to admin settings. Ensure that the source record type is configured before the related record type. If the relationship is not displayed, reorder the record types in admin settings. More information: [Impact of the order of record types on relationships](customize-forms-and-fields.md#impact-of-the-order-of-record-types-on-relationships)

## Security, Privacy and Compliance 

### How does Microsoft protect customer data privacy? 

Microsoft is uniquely positioned to deliver enterprise-ready AI. Powered by Azure OpenAI Service, Copilot features built-in responsible AI and enterprise-grade Azure security. 

1. Built on Microsoft's comprehensive approach to security, compliance, and privacy 

    Copilot is integrated into Microsoft services like Dynamics 365, Microsoft Power Platform, and Microsoft 365, and automatically inherits all the customer’s valuable security, compliance, and privacy policies and processes. Two-factor authentication, compliance boundaries, privacy protections, and more make Copilot the AI solution customers can trust. 

1. Architected to protect tenant, group, and individual data 

    We know data leakage is a concern for customers. LLMs aren't further trained on, or learn from, customer tenant data or user prompts. Within the customer’s own tenant, our time-tested permissions model provides safeguards and enterprise-grade security as seen in our Azure offerings. And on an individual level, Copilot presents only data one can access using the same technology that we’ve been using for years to secure customer data. 

1. Designed to learn new skills 

    Copilot’s foundation skills are a game changer for productivity and business processes. The capabilities allow you to create, summarize, analyze, collaborate, and automate using your specific business content and context. But it doesn’t stop there. Copilot recommends actions for the user (for example, “create a time and expense application to enable employees to submit their time and expense reports”). And Copilot is designed to learn new skills. For example, Copilot can learn how to connect to CRM systems of record to pull customer data—like interaction and order histories—into communications. As Copilot learns about new domains and processes, it will be able to perform even more sophisticated tasks and queries. 

### How will Microsoft use customer data to train Copilot for Sales?  

Copilot unlocks business value by connecting LLMs to the customer’s own business data in a secure, complaint, privacy-preserving way. 

Copilot generates answers anchored in real-time business content (customer's own documents, emails, calendar, chats, meetings, contacts, and other business data) and combines them with working context, the meeting the user is in now, the email exchanges had on a topic, the chat conversations had last week, and  to deliver accurate, relevant, contextual responses. 

Microsoft, however, doesn't use customers' data to train LLMs. We believe the customers’ data is their data, aligned to [Microsoft's data privacy policy](https://aka.ms/privacy). AI-powered LLMs are trained on a large but limited corpus of data. Prompts, responses, and data accessed through Microsoft Graph and Microsoft services aren't used to train Microsoft Copilot for Sales capabilities for use by other customers. Furthermore, the foundation models aren't improved through usage of Copilot by individual customers. This means the customer’s own data is accessible only by authorized users within their organization unless the customer explicitly consents to other access or use. 

### How will Copilot for Sales manage GDPR policies?  

Copilot for Sales complies with GDPR policies.

The Dynamics App for Outlook is strictly an enablement app that bridges the gap between outlook and DV data. The app isn't being invested in, but rather we're focusing on bringing critical enablement features to the Copilot for Sales App in addition to all of the empowerment features related to generative AI and insights to help sellers get the job done in the context of their work in Outlook. Sellers should encourage their customers to migrate to the Copilot for Sales app to take advantage of our innovation and investments (two existing gaps, entity creation and entity global search are being worked on and should be delivered in the first quarter of 2024).
