Sales Agent creates personalized email drafts for each lead by using comprehensive research data to ensure your emails are both relevant and compelling. This capability transforms all the research effort done from the previous stage into actionable results while reducing the time you spend crafting individual emails and increasing your overall engagement rates.

Email drafts generated by Sales Agent have talking points that are relevant to the lead, based on the research data. These are the strategic insights that provide foundation for your message content. Talking points may include recent company developments or news, role-specific insights based on the prospect's position, and product interest signals. You can select the talking points you want to include in the email draft. The email draft also includes a subject line and a call to action, which is the next step you want the lead to take. You can customize the subject line and call to action as needed.

By default, the email draft is generated in the language set in Office 365 settings. If you're recaching out to a prospect in a different language, you can translate the email draft to that language. This allows you to communicate effectively with leads in their preferred language, enhancing the personalization and relevance of your outreach.

This capability provides you with complete control over your outreach process while significantly reducing the time required for email composition. You can reach more leads faster, deliver personalized emails that aren't generic templates, thereby boosting reply and meeting rates.
