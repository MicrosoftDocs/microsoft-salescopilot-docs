Sales Agent creates personalized email drafts for each lead by leveraging comprehensive research data to ensure your emails are both relevant and compelling. This capability transforms all the research effort done from the previous stage into actionable results while reducing the time you spend crafting individual emails and increasing your overall engagement rates.

Email drafts generated by Sales Agent have talking points that are relevant to the lead, based on the research data. These are the strategic insights that provide foundation for your message content. Talking points may include recent company developments or news, role-specific insights based on the prospect's position, and product interest signals. You can select the talking points you want to include in the email draft. The email draft also includes a subject line and a call to action, which is the next step you want the lead to take. You can customize the subject line and call to action as needed.

This capability provides you with complete control over your outreach process while significantly reducing the time required for email composition. You can reach more leads faster, deliver personalized emails that are not generic templates, thereby boosting reply and meeting rates.
