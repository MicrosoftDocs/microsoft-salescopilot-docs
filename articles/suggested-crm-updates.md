# View suggested CRM updates

When interacting with your customers over email, you often need to update your CRM system with the latest information. Manually updating the CRM system every time you interact with customers via email can be time-consuming and error prone. 

Copilot for Sales uses AI to suggest CRM updates based on the email conversations. Suggestions include update to estimated revenue and close date of the opportunity to which the email is connected. If the email isn't connected to an opportunity, you can choose an opportunity you want to update with the suggestions.

The suggestions are displayed in the **Suggested actions** card in the Copilot for Sales pane. If there are no suggestions, the card isn't displayed. When you update a record with the suggested updates, the suggestion is marked as complete.

## Update CRM with suggested updates

Copilot for Sales scans the email conversations and compares the data with the data in the CRM system to suggest updates. The updates are suggested for the following fields in an opportunity record in CRM system:

| Suggested update | CRM field |
|------------------|-----------|
| Budget | Dynamics 365 Sales: Est. Revenue (logical name: [estimatedvalue](/dynamics365/sales/developer/entities/opportunity#BKMK_EstimatedValue)) <br>Salesforce: Amount     |
| Close date | Dynamics 365 Sales: Est. Close Date (logical name: [estimatedclosedate](/dynamics365/sales/developer/entities/opportunity#BKMK_EstimatedCloseDate)) <br>Salesforce: Close Date |

### Update CRM from the Suggested actions card

1. In the Copilot for Sales pane, go to the **Suggested actions** card.

1. Select **Update opportunity** for the update you want to apply. Based on whether the email is connected to an opportunity or not, the following happens:

    - If the email is connected to an opportunity, the opportunity form opens in the Copilot for Sales pane.
