# Use Copilot for Sales app during a meeting

The Copilot for Sales app in Microsoft Teams helps you prepare for and conduct meetings with your sales contacts. You can also view and edit the connected CRM record.

## License requirements

Capabilities mentioned in this article are available to users with either the older Sales Copilot license or the newer Copilot for Sales license.

## Open the Copilot for Sales app

Select the **Copilot for Sales** icon on the meeting toolbar. The **Copilot for Sales** panel opens on the right side of the meeting window. If you don't see the Copilot for Sales icon, select **Apps** and then select **Copilot for Sales**.

> [!NOTE]
> You must invite at least one connected contact for Outlook to add the Copilot for Sales app to the meeting.

If the meeting is connected to an opportunity in CRM, an [opportunity summary](view-opportunity-summary.md) card is displayed showing the key details and status of the current opportunity.

The connected record appears in the **Connected to** card. If the meeting isn't connected and saved to CRM, a message appears to save and connect the meeting to a CRM record. For details about saving a meeting to CRM, see [Save Outlook activities to your CRM](save-outlook-activities-crm.md).

## View and edit connected record details

With the Copilot for Sales app, you can view and edit the connected CRM record during the meeting in Teams. The app helps you access and update the CRM record in the flow of your work.

> [!NOTE]
> You must [save and connect the meeting to a CRM record](save-outlook-activities-crm.md) to view details of the connected record.

1. [Open Copilot for Sales](#open-the-copilot-for-sales-app).

1. In the **Connected to** card, select the record to see its details in the **Copilot for Sales** panel.

You can also open a record in CRM to view its complete details. The record details open in a new tab. Perform either of the following actions to open a record in CRM:

- Hover over the record, select **More actions** (**...**), and then select **Open in (CRM)**.

- Select the record to see its details in the **Copilot for Sales** panel, select **More actions** (**...**), and then select **Open in (CRM)**.

### Copy link to connected record

You can copy a link to the connected record and then share it in a Teams chat or an email message. When you paste the record's link into a Teams chat, it will unfurl into a rich adaptive card. When you paste the record's link in an email message, a link to the record is pasted.

1. [Open Copilot for Sales](#open-the-copilot-for-sales-app).

1. Hover over the record and select **More actions** (**...**) > **Copy link**.

Alternatively, you can select the connected record to open its details, and then select **More actions** (**...**) > **Copy link**.
