# Use Copilot for Sales app during a meeting

The Copilot for Sales app in Microsoft Teams helps you prepare for and conduct meetings with your sales contacts. You can view the meeting preparation card, view and edit the connected CRM record, and get real-time sales tips during the meeting. These features help you stay focused on the meeting and close deals faster.

## License requirements

Capabilities mentioned in this article are available to users with either the older Sales Copilot license or the newer Copilot for Sales license.

## Open the Copilot for Sales app

Select the **Copilot for Sales** icon on the meeting toolbar. The **Copilot for Sales** panel opens on the right side of the meeting window. If you don't see the Copilot for Sales icon, select **Apps** and then select **Copilot for Sales**.

> [!NOTE]
> You must invite at least one connected contact for Outlook to add the Copilot for Sales app to the meeting.

If the meeting is connected to an opportunity in CRM, an [opportunity summary](view-opportunity-summary.md) card is displayed showing the key details and status of the current opportunity.

The connected record appears in the **Connected to** card. If the meeting isn't connected and saved to CRM, a message appears to save and connect the meeting to a CRM record. For details about saving a meeting to CRM, see [Save Outlook activities to your CRM](save-outlook-activities-crm.md).

## Get real-time sales tips

As a seller, you can get real-time sales tips during your meetings with sales contacts in the Copilot for Sales panel in Microsoft Teams. These tips provide information about competitors or brands mentioned in the meeting, and help you respond to inquiries. The information you need is right in front of you, and leads to better communication and helps you close deals faster.

> [!NOTE]
> - You must transcribe the meeting to get real-time sales tips.
> - You must check the content carefully. AI-generated summaries may be missing information and can contain inaccurate details.

To view real-time sales tips during a meeting, [open the Copilot for Sales app](#open-the-copilot-for-sales-app).

If you don't start transcribing the meeting, you see a banner that encourages you to record the meeting to get real-time sales tips.

An introduction card is displayed in the Copilot for Sales panel explaining how real-time sales tips work and the benefits they offer.

When you start recording the meeting, the real-time sales tips are displayed in the **Copilot for Sales** panel. When someone on the call mentions a brand or a competitor, a card automatically shows key information from Bing or your CRM to help you get context and respond quickly to inquiries. You must select **Get brand info** to view detailed information.

The brand information is based on a Bing knowledge graph. The competitor information is displayed from your CRM system, if it's available, and includes strengths and weaknesses of the competitor mentioned in the meeting.
