# FAQ for real-time sales tips feature in Microsoft Teams

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of Microsoft 365 Copilot for Sales's real-time sales tips feature in Teams.

## What is real-time sales tips feature in Teams? 

Copilot for Sales provides real-time assistance for sellers during virtual Teams meetings, to help them overcome objections and competitor mentions. Triggered by the call transcript, this feature provides a hands-free experience, so sellers can leverage the suggested content to smoothly incorporate it in their sales pitch without any unnecessary distractions. 

## What are the feature's capabilities? 

During Teams meetings, Copilot for Sales analyzes the meeting transcription and finds helpful information about the companies and brands discussed. It creates easy-to-read cards with data from CRM or Bing that show sellers competitive or brand information. These cards appear in the Copilot for Sales panel in real time to help have more effective conversations.

## What is the feature's intended use? 

With this feature, sellers can get useful insights on the companies and competitors being mentioned during their sales meetings. This way, they can tailor their pitch and boost their sales performance.

## How was the real-time sales tips feature evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance? 

The feature is evaluated through a combination of comparative analysis, human review, and customer engagement metrics. Performance is measured based on criteria such as accuracy, relevance, engagement, and customer satisfaction. Click rates gauge the effectiveness of real-time suggestions. 

End-users provide ongoing feedback on each Copilot feature, along with iterative improvements contribute to optimizing the system's performance across all features.

## What are the limitations of this feature? How can users minimize the impact of the limitations when using the system? 

The suggestions that appear automatically in real time may not include all the brands and companies that were mentioned. How well the system transcribes your speech affects how accurate and complete the suggestions are. The summaries from CRM might also miss some important information from the original data source (CRM). To make sure the suggestions are relevant and helpful, the users should check and adjust them as needed. Users can also look at the data sources directly to get more details.
