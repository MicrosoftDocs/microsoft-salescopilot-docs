Copilot for Sales provides real-time assistance for sellers during virtual Teams meetings, to help them overcome objections and competitor mentions. Triggered by the call transcript, this feature provides a hands-free experience, so sellers can leverage the suggested content to smoothly incorporate it in their sales pitch without any unnecessary distractions. 

## What are the feature's capabilities? 

During Teams meetings, Copilot for Sales analyzes the meeting transcription and finds helpful information about the companies and brands discussed. It creates easy-to-read cards with data from CRM or Bing that show sellers competitive or brand information. These cards appear in the Copilot for Sales panel in real time to help have more effective conversations.

## What is the feature's intended use? 

With this feature, sellers can get useful insights on the companies and competitors being mentioned during their sales meetings. This way, they can tailor their pitch and boost their sales performance.

## How was the real-time sales tips feature evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?
