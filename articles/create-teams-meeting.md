# Create a Teams meeting

Your Copilot for Sales journey starts when you schedule a Microsoft Teams meeting and invite at least one external participant. The Copilot for Sales app is added automatically to the meeting. If the app is not added automatically, you can manually add it to the meeting.

## Add the Copilot for Sales app automatically to a Teams meeting

The Copilot for Sales app is added automatically to a Teams meeting when the following conditions are met:

- You must invite at least one external participant to the meeting.  
- You must transcribe the meeting for Copilot for Sales to generate insights.  

If you create a recurring meeting, the Copilot for Sales app is added to all occurrences of the meeting if the above conditions are met.

> [!NOTE]
> If your administrator has enabled the [auto recording capability](auto-record-meeting.md), the meeting is recorded automatically when the Copilot for Sales app is added to the meeting.

## Add the Copilot for Sales app manually to a Teams meeting

If the Copilot for Sales app is not added automatically to a Teams meeting, a meeting organizer can manually add the app to the meeting. The app is visible only to the participants who are in the same tenant as the meeting organizer.  
Once the app is added to a recurring meeting, it's added to all occurrences of the meeting.  
For steps to manually add the Copilot for Sales app to a Teams meeting, see [How can I add the Copilot for Sales app manually to a Teams meeting?](sales-copilot-faq.md#how-can-i-add-the-copilot-for-sales-app-manually-to-a-teams-meeting)

> [!NOTE]
> If you try to add the app without signing in to the app from Outlook, a message is displayed to sign in to the app from Outlook. You must sign in to the app from Outlook and then select **Refresh** in the message to add the app to the meeting.
