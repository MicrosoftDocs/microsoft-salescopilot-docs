The **Opportunity insights** card provides you with a consolidated view of opportunity-related emails and meetings, highlighting risks and upcoming actions to help you stay updated without leaving Outlook. The card offers a detailed perspective on opportunities by analyzing all related emails and meetings, helping you understand potential risks and progress. For an opportunity, Copilot for Sales provides AI-generated insights to indicate how the opportunity is evolving.

When working on opportunities, you often juggle multiple activities, making it challenging to keep track of key insights from each interaction. The **Opportunity insights** card brings together all these events and surfaces opportunity-level insights directly within Outlook. If you've access to an opportunity in CRM, you can see insights from all relevant emails and meetings, even those you did not attend. This helps you stay updated and informed without leaving your workflow. 

> [!NOTE]
> - The **Opportunity insights** card is displayed only when the email is connected to an opportunity. Once the opportunity is connected, the card displays insights from all relevant emails and meetings.
> - Meetings don't necessarily have to be saved to an opportunity for it to show up in the **Opportunity insights** card. The opportunity is identified based on the meeting content and contacts.
