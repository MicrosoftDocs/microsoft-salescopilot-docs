The **Opportunity insights** card provides you with a consolidated view of opportunity-related meetings, highlighting risks and upcoming actions to help you stay updated without leaving Outlook. The card offers a detailed perspective on the opportunity by analyzing all related meetings, helping you understand potential risks and progress. For an opportunity, Copilot for Sales provides AI-generated insights to indicate how the opportunity is evolving.

When working on opportunities, you often juggle multiple activities, making it challenging to keep track of key insights from each interaction. The **Opportunity insights** card brings together all these events and surfaces opportunity-level insights directly within Outlook. If you've access to an opportunity in CRM, you can see insights from all relevant meetings, even those you did not attend. This helps you stay updated and informed without leaving your workflow. 

## Where to see the Opportunity insights card

You can see the **Opportunity insights** card in the Copilot for Sales side pane in Outlook when you open an email or a meeting.

> [!NOTE]
> - When viewing an email, the **Opportunity insights** card is displayed only when the email is connected to an opportunity. Once the opportunity is connected, the card displays insights from all relevant meetings.
> - When viewing a meeting in Outlook calendar, the **Opportunity insights** card is displayed only when the meeting is connected to an opportunity.
