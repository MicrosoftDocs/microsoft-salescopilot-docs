## What is Sales Agent?

Sales Agent uses a combination of internal and external data sources to research leads. It connects to your CRM (Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales or Salesforce Sales Cloud) to find leads, and then uses the web and third-party data services to gather additional information about the lead's company, recent news, and other relevant insights.
Sales Agent also generates personalized outreach emails based on the insights gathered during the research process. These emails are tailored to the lead's interests and needs, increasing the chances of a positive response.

## What are the feature's capabilities?

Sales Agent utilizes large language models (LLM), natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning algorithms to analyze salesperson input, customer data, and historical email interactions. It leverages this information to generate tailored email drafts by suggesting content, subject lines, and personalized messaging, enhancing the salesperson's ability to engage with customers effectively.

## What is the feature's intended use? 

The intended use of this feature is to assist salespeople in qualifying leads and creating effective and personalized email drafts to communicate with customers.
