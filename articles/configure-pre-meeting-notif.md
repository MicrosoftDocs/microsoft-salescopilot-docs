# Configure the time of pre-meeting notifications

As an administrator, you can configure the time of pre-meeting notifications for your organization. Pre-meeting notifications are sent to sellers before their meetings to help them prepare. You can choose if a daliy summary of meetings should be sent to sellers or if they should receive notifications before each meeting or both. 

## Configure daily summary of meetings

The daily summary of meetings helps sellers stay organized by providing a single notification summarizing the next five upcoming sales meetings. It reduces notification fatigue while delivering critical insights. The notification categorizes meetings by date, includes clickable meeting titles, and provides essential details like duration and agenda summaries.

By default, the daily summary of meetings is sent at 7:30 AM in the seller's time zone. You can change the time based on your organizational needs.

To configure the time of daily summary of meetings:

1. In Copilot for Sales admin settings, select **Meeting agent**.
2. Under **Notifications**, select **Daily digest**.
3. In the **Daily digest** pane, select **On** or **Off** to enable or disable the feature.
4. From the **Delivery time** list, select the time when the daily digest is sent. By default, 7:30 AM is selected.
5. Select **Save**.

## Configure pre-meeting preparation notifications

[Pre-meeting preparation notifications](meeting-prep.md) are sent to sellers before each meeting to help them prepare. By default, pre-meeting preparation notifications are sent one hour before the meeting. You can change the time based on your organizational needs.

To configure the time of pre-meeting preparation notifications:

1. In Copilot for Sales admin settings, select **Meeting agent**.
2. Under **Notifications**, select **Pre-meeting preparation**.
3. In the **Pre-meeting preparation** pane, select **On** or **Off** to enable or disable the feature.
4. From the **Delivery interval** list, select the time interval before the meeting when the notification is sent. By default, 1 hour is selected.
5. Select **Save**.
