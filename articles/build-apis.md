# Build Copilot for Sales extensions (preview)

[!INCLUDE [production-ready-preview-dynamics365](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-dynamics365.md)]

This section outlines what Copilot for Sales expects from your application APIs that either enhance an existing capability or introduce a new one. It covers the following aspects:

- The input context that your application APIs can expect from Copilot for Sales (the capability)
- The type of insights that each capability can show in the user interface (and therefore what your APIs should provide)
- The descriptions that are needed at the API level, and for each API input and output, to help Copilot for Sales identify the correct API to invoke at runtime

> [!NOTE]
> Although these definitions are provided with high confidence, they are subject to change based on our internal reviews, testing, and feedback. Some descriptions might currently be empty. We are in the process of defining these descriptions and will provide updates in a future version of the guide.
