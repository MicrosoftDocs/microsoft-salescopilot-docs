## Prepare for your Sales meetings

The meeting preparation feature in Microsoft 365 Copilot helps you enter every customer meeting with confidence and the right information. It shows AI-generated insights, CRM data, and recent communications into a single, easy-to-read view that is embedded alongside Sales agent chat interface, so you can quickly ask follow-up questions or dig deeper—without leaving your workflow.

> [!NOTE]
> - The meeting preparation feature is only available in the full-screen mode of Sales in Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat experience. It's not available when using Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat in Outlook, Word, PowerPoint, Excel, or Dynamics 365.
> - Specific licensing requirements apply when you use meeting preparation card Microsoft 365 Copilot. Learn more in [Microsoft Product Terms](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2309718).

Under the chat box of the Sales agent, you can see a list of upcoming sales meetings (a meeting with at least one external contact) scheduled in the next 24 hours. The meeting card displays up to three high-value AI highlights to help you prepare more effectively. Each highlight is written to be actionable and concise, enabling you to absorb the most important context in seconds. In some cases, you might see a message indicating that meeting insights are not available. This can occur when insights are still being generated for newly scheduled meetings. Check back later, as it typically takes at least 15 minutes for insights to be generated for new meetings.

Select **Prepare with insights** to open the [detailed meeting preparation view](meeting-prep.md#detailed-meeting-preparation-view) alongside Sales agent chat interface. This allows you to explore deeper insights, ask follow-up questions, and access additional context without leaving your workflow.
