# View recent and upcoming activities

If you've interacted with a customer through Outlook and Teams, Copilot for Sales displays your recent emails and recent and upcoming meetings in the **Related items** card in the saved contact details. By default, three activities are displayed. To see up to 10 activities, select **Show more**.
