# View customer communication (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

The **Customer communication** card shows a chronological view of your interactions with a customer, including meetings. This card helps you catch up and gain insights into all the activities that have happened for a given opportunity. You can see all the meetings related to the opportunity. For each meeting, Copilot for Sales provides AI-generated insights such as the summary, sentiment, objections, and next steps.

When working on opportunities, you often manage numerous activities, such as meetings, making it difficult to keep track of every interaction and discussion. The **Customer communication** card consolidates all these events and provides insights for each of them. If you've access to an opportunity in CRM, you can view insights from related meetings, even if you did not attend the meeting. This helps you stay updated and informed without leaving your workflow.
